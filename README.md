# DES-Algorithm-Crypto
Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher algorithm that takes plain text in blocks of 64 bits and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 48 bits. It is a symmetric key algorithm, which means that the same key is used for encrypting and decrypting data. The following code implements the Encryption part of DES
## Input Format
The first line contains the PlainText in the form of a string S (len(S)=16). The second line contains the Key for the encryption in the form of string K (len(K)=16)
